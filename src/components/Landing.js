        <p className='paragraph'>Hello world! My name is Zev, also known as ZevDev, or on occasion, Zevobanskidani. I am a Canadian teen 
            designer, programmer, and artist. My dream is to become a successful indie video game designer! I hope to use my 
            technical skills and creative vision to create work that no one has seen before. Welcome to my scratch-made website: 
            You can explore my progress in my creative endeavours here.</p>
