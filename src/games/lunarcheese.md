Wowie! game jam

note: the game is available in the browser from both this site and the Itch.io website, but I strongly recommend playing it here as I will post updates and fixes for the website version of the game.

Known bugs:

-Corruptions sometimes just pause spawning. Nobody knows why - especially not me.

-Softlock occurs when you have no more Minerbots, as no more bots can spawn due to halted progression.

more details will be added when I have time to write!
